# EM_CAD_frontend
This project is to allow programatic control of FreeCAD. The initial driver for this was to be able to reproducibly generate sets of models for use in EM simulation work. The focus is on generating models for various vacuum chambers.

The basic use is to define apertures. Then extrude them to form a tube, or taper from one aperture to another in order to form a transition. 
RF ports can also be constructed.
In principle any geometry available through the python FreeCAD interface can be used to construct models.

Once the base model is constructed, variations can be generated by defining parameter sweeps. Multiple parameter sweeps can be defined. For example if the base model has an aperture height of 10mm you can define a parameter sweep for 'aperture height' of [5E-3, 15E-3, 20E-3] to generate an aditional three models with aperture heights of 5mm, 15mm and 20mm.

This is currently being used with FreeCAD 0.18.
